### 👋 greetings, fellow data nerds and tech enthusiasts

- 🤓 **me**: a self-proclaimed *data scientist with product mindset* - just like a superhero who battles business problems using the power of numbers. My 🧠 (a.k.a a neural net) is so crammed with statistics that it might as well be a Excel spreadsheet.
- 🫀 with data in my blood and engineer in my heart, I'm currently exploring the wild world of ML, LLMs and their application. Imagine if you could merge the wisdom of Yoda and the power of Google - that's what I'm after!
- ⚠️ **spoiler alert**: my repos are packed with code snippets and small projects that showcase my obsession with CS, DS, ML and AI.
- 🫃🏼 **favorite coders**: ![karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy), ![geohotz](https://github.com/geohot), ![devaslife](https://github.com/craftzdog).
